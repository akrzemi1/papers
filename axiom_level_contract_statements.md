Axiom-Level Contract Statements
===============================

Current [[WD]][1] allows axiom-level contract statements to be evaluated at runtime. This is contradictory with the design
goals for axiom-level contract statements outlined in [[P0380r0]][2], which explicitly notes that the goal for axiom-level 
contract statements is to allow functions without definitions. In this paper we propose to make it clear that a program is 
guaranteed, in any build level, to compile and link fine when conditions in axiom-level contract statements contain references
to objects and functions without definitions.


### Non-goals

At the same time we want to preserve the guarantee from [[WD]][1] that if the implementaiton can somehow determine the value that the 
predicate would return, it should be able to use this information for optimization or correctness verification purposes. 
Such optimizations are controversial and considered a defficiency in [[WD]][1] by some parties, but we consider it an orthogonal issue
to the one discussed in thes paper.

In this paper we do not discuss side effects being allowed in axiom-level contact statements. That will be the subject of another paper.


What we need
------------

We need to be able to declare predicates like:

```c++
template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S>
  bool is_reachable(I b, S e); // never defined

template <typename T>
  bool points_to_heap_object(T* p); // never defined
```

They are unimplementable, therefore they are only declared but never defined. They are still useful for static analysis. We want to be able to put them in axiom-level contract statements and have the guarantee that we will never get a linker error saying 
that an odr-used symbol is missing, regrdless of any build level.

At the same time, it is plausible that the implementation can understand the semantics of our condition and by some other means 
it can compute the result without causing any side effects and without odr-using any new entity in the condition. Such result could be used for optimization purposes, or for additional correctness validation. The current [[WD]][1] allows this and we do not want to prevent this.

Note that with this change contract statements with level `axiom` will become substantially different from other levels: only for them the "no linkage problems" guarantee applies. (`audit` and `default` levels require defineitions even if they are not evaluated in the current build level.)

To summarize our goal:

1. Missing definitions of entities (objects or functions) in the condition of an axiom-level contract statement never make the program ill-formed. Same as inside `sizeof()` or `decltype()`.
2. Optimizations still potentially enabled if there is a way to determine the predicate result without violating point 1.


Proposed wording
----------------

Modifications apply to section [dcl.attr.contract.cond].


#### Modify paragraph 4:

During constant expression evaluation, only predicates of checked contracts are evaluated. In other contexts, it is unspecified whether
the predicate for a contract <ins>with *contract-level* ohter than `axiom`</ins> that is not checked under the current build level is 
evaluated; if the predicate of such a contract would evaluate to `false`, the behavior is undefined.

#### Add paragraph at the end:

The predicate `p` of a contract condition with `axiom` *contract-level* is an unevaluated operand. If an implementation is able to 
determine, by means not specified by this Intrnational Standard, what the value would be returned by evaluating `p`, and this value is `false`, the behavior is undefined. 

[*Example:*
```c++
bool pred(int i);  // never defined

void f(int * p)
  [[expects axiom: p && pred(*p)]];

void g(int * p)
{
  f(p);
  if (p != nullptr) // the check can be elided
    *p = 0;
}
```
Implementation can eliminate the check `p != nullptr` in function `g`. If `p` was null, the precondition of `f` would evaluate
to `false`, which would be undefined behavior. The potential contract violation can be determined without the call to function
`pred` owing to the semantics of operator `&&`.
