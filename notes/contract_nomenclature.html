<h1>Proposed nomenclature for contract-related proposals</h1>

<p>This document proposes a number of definitions that we recomend to authors of contract-related proposals, and SG21 members for use, in order to avoid misunderstandings.
   The definitions have been chosen so that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Names that have overloaded meaning, are ambiguous or misleading are avoided; in particular: 
   <ul> 
   <li>"assume" -- as it is not clear who assumes, is it a voluntary action or a command, and what the implication of the
      assumption is. Or it could mean "function <em>assumes</em> that its precondition holds".</li>
   <li>"expect" -- as it is not clear who expects and why would anyone else care what the other person or function expects; 
      you can "expect" that people will use your function incorrectly.</li>
   <li>"assert" -- as "assert" could mean "trust me, I say it and this is true", or "test this hypothesis for me".</li>
   <li>"check" (used alone) / "contract check" -- as it implies that some run-time checking will be performed or required, whereas some predicates are not even 
      expressible as code that could be executed.</li>
   <li>"contract" (used alone) -- as this is something between the humans: not something that function declarations or the 
      implementation would ever be affected with.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
  
<li>The focus is shifted from generating additional code for run-time checking by the compiler to declaring information
   consumable by other tools that the Standard refers to as "implementation", such as static analyzers or sanitzers.</p>
   </li>
 
</ol>
  
  
<h2><a name="recommendations">Recommended definitions</a></h2>  


<h3><a name="recommendations.contract_annotation"><em>Contract annotation</em></a></h3>  

<p>It has a <em>location</em> in code: e.g., just before the function execution begins, or just after the function execution end successfully.
   It has a <em>predicate</em>, such as <code>p != nullptr</code>. Its "semantics" is: if the execution reaches the location of contract anntation,
   and the predicate can be determined (not necessarily by evaluating it) to be <code>false</code>, then the program has a <em>contract violation</em>.
   The information about a contract violation in the program
   can be used in different ways by different tools, including the compiler. 
   </p> 

<p>Thus, contract annotation helps provide a definition of a bug that is understandabe by machines.
   Becuse contract violation is for sure a manifestation of a bug.
   </p>
   
<p>Rationale: A longer term "contract annotation" is recommended in order to avoid shorter "contract" which can also mean "everything that function guarantees and expects,
   including runtime performance guaranties."</p>


<h3><a name="recommendations.contract_annotation"><em>Contract violation</em></a></h3> 

<p>A contract violation results from an interaction between the code before the contract annotation and the contact annotation 
itself. The behavior of a program with a contract violation can differ from one translation to the other based on compiler 
switches. This is similar to implementation-defined behavior except that we try to specify in more detail what the variance
in behavior is, and under what conditions.</p>

<p>A program with a contract violation can still be a well-formed, UB-free program. Unless other UB kicks in later on, you can
still reason about the behavior of the program in terms of operations on the abstract machine.</p>

<p> Contract violation is a symptom of a bug located either before the contract annotation or inside its predicate. 
    Contract annotations can detect symptoms of bugs, but not bugs themselves. Implementations are encouraged to detect
	and prevent contract violations by different means. It is generally agreed that &mdash; except for unit-test context &mdash; 
	contract violation is something unintended by the programmer. </p>

<p>Rationale: speaking in terms of "contract violation" (or the lack thereof) avoids using word "expect" as in
   "a precondition is 'expected' to hold". But it is not clear if an "expectation" has any formal meaning or
   consequences. Term "library UB" is also not encouraged as there might be no library in sight when a programmer
   puts a contract annotation in her function.</p>

<h3><a name="recommendations.fact"><em>Fact</em></a></h3> 

<p> An information that an implementation has about state of variables at the given point of program executon.
    A fact can be used for different things by the implementation, including code transformtions. E.g., 
    </p>

<pre>int normalize(int i)
{
  if (i &gt; 0) return 1;
  if (i &lt; 0) return -1;
  
  <em>// at this point it is a fact that `i == 0`</em>
  return i; <em>// can be replaced with `return 0;`</em>
}
</pre>

<h4><a name="recommendations.fact.derived"><em>Derived fact</em></a></h4> 

<p> A fact, like the one illustrated above, that the implementation obtains by means other than direct input from the programmer.
    A fact derived from other facts is a derived fact.
    </p>


<h4><a name="recommendations.fact.ub_derived"><em>UB-derived fact</em></a></h4> 


<p>A derived fact obtained through special properties of undefined behavior; e.g.,</p>

<pre>int g(int i)
{
  if (i != 0)
    *((void*)0) = 0; <em>// UB</em>
  
  <em>// at this point it is an (injected) fact that `i == 0`</em>
  return i; <em>// can be replaced with `return 0;`</em>
}</pre>


<h4><a name="recommendations.fact.injected"><em>Injected fact</em></a></h4> 

<p>An injected fact is a fact that an implementation cannot derive by other means than by direct input from the programmer
   through a dedicated instruction. </p>

<pre>int f(int i)
{
  __builtin_assume(i == 0); <em>// Compiler is allowed to apply code transformations as if `i == 0` were true.</em>
  
  <em>// at this point it is an (injected) fact that `i == 0`</em>
  return i; <em>// can be replaced with `return 0;`</em>
}</pre>

<p> Rationale: The usage of somewhat artificial terms "injected/derived fact" is recommended in order to avoid terms "assume" and "assert" that
    have multiple meanings in this context.</p>

<h3><a name="recommendations.fact.runtime_check"><em>Run-time check</em></a></h3> 

<p>From a contract annotation in location <em>L</em> with predicate <code>P</code>, an implementation can, under implementation-defined conditions (but we try to specify the conditions with "levels", "build modes" and other "toggles"), insert at location <em>L</em> a piece of code that is executed at run-time, possibly with side effects, of the form:</p>


<pre>{
  if (!(P)) HANDLE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION();
}
</pre>

<p>This is called a <em>run-time check</em>. <code>HANDLE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION()</code> is subject to further implementation-defined behavior,
   such as calling user-provided funcion, or doing nothing, or maybe doing something even different.
   </p>

<p>This definition leaves open the question whether or not <code>P</code> should be allowed to have side effects, as well as what "side effects" would mean in this context.
   </p>

<p>When a run-time check is inserted from a contract annotation with predicate <code>P</code>, and <code>HANDLE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION()</code>
   is a call to a function that never returns normally, then <code>P</code> is a derived fact after the run-time check.
   </p> 
   
<p>Rationale: using a compound "run-time check" as something produced from "contract annotation" makes it clear that the two are different things.
   A run-time check is only one of a number of uses of contract annotations.
   </p>    
   

<h3><a name="recommendations.function_contract"><em>Function contract</em></a></h3> 

<p> A <em>function contract</em> is a full description of function semantics available both to the function's implementer and
    to the callers; it contains sufficient information for the caller to be able to call the function correctly. 
	
    Part of function contract is communicated by the type-system, e.g., the number and the types of function arguments. Parts
    of function contract that cannot be communicated by the type-system are communicated by other means, such as library
    documentation, or comments in the code.
	
    Function contract includes (but is not limited to):		
</p>

<ul>
	<li>how the valus in function arguments are interpretted,</li>
	<li>how the returned value is to be interpretted,</li>
	<li>what the function is supposed to do,</li>
	<li>run-time complexity,</li>
	<li>how and under what conditions function failures are reported,</li>
	<li>what resources are managed by the function,</li>
	<li>how the state of the program changes.</li>
    </ul>

<p> From the description of how the input arguments are interpretted it can be deduced what values of input arguments are not
    allowed by the function, i.e., for which function does not provide any interpretation. Similarly, from the description of
    how the return value needs to be interpretted it can be deduced what values are never returned from the function (provided
    that the arguments passed into the function have a valid interpretation under the function contract). Therefore, 
    preconditions and postconditions are not essential parts of a function contract, but they simply a consequence of the
    essential part of function contract.
    </p>
	
<p> As an example, the following function declaration:
    </p>    
	
<pre>int make_random(int min, int max, Generator* g);</pre>

<p>Can be accompained by the following comment indicating its contract:</p>

<pre>
<em>// (1) generates an integral random number with uniform distribution</em>
<em>// (2) in closed range [min, max]</em>
<em>// (3) using the generator pointed to by g</em>
<em>// (4) in time no greater than 100&micro;s</em>
</pre>

<p> (2) implies precondition <code>(min &lt;= max)</code>. (3) implies two preconditions: first is <code>(g != nullptr)</code>,
    seconod is that <code>g</code> points to a valid object of type <code>Generator</code> or derived
    (which subsumes the former precondition). (1) and (2) imply two postconditions: first is 
    <code>(min &lt;= result &amp;&amp; result &lt;= max)</code>, the other is that <code>result</code> is a product of
    uniform distribution.
    </p>

<p> Thus, contract annotations associated with a given function <code>f</code> are implied by <code>f</code>'s contract.
    Some of them can be expressed as C++ expressions and used as quick tests to determine if function contract has been
    violated; but (as any tests) they cannot be used to determine with certainty if <code>f</code> is used within contract.
    </p>


<p> Rationale: Using a longer term "function contract" makes it clear that we do not mean a single precondition/postcondition.
    </p>


<h2><a name="literature">Ackowledgements</a></h2>

<p>The distinction between the contract as a whole and individual preconditions and postconditions was taken from 
   <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1332r0.txt">[P1332r0]</a>. The unambiguous terms "injected fact"
   and "derived fact" have been suggested by Herb Sutter.
