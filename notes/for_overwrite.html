<h1>Attribute <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code></h1>

<p> This paper proposes to add a standard attribute <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code>,
    which may appertain to a variable or a non-static data member declaration, indicatng
    that the value set upon initialization is intended never to be read: instead,
    another modification of the value is expected before the value is read for the first time.
    </p>

<h2><a name="mot">1. Motivation <span class="link">{mot}</span></a></h2>


<p> In C++, much like in C, you can declare a scalar variable without providing its initial value:</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  int i;         <em>// no initial value</em>
  cin &gt;&gt; i;      <em>// value assigned</em>
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1; <em>// value read</em>
}
</pre> 


<p> Because of this, it is possible to create a program where a scalar variable
    is read from before it is assigned value. This results in undefined behavior.
    No-one would write a program like this on purpose, but it may occur as
    a result of a bug somewhere in the code.</p>
    
<pre>
int main()
{
  int i, j;
  
  cin &gt;&gt; j;
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1; <em>// typo: intended: `j + 1`</em>
    
  cin &gt;&gt; i;  
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1;
}
</pre> 

<p> This is becaue the separation of the object creation from the initial
    value assignment is bug prone. For this reason programmers are advised
    to move the creation of the variable as close as possible to the place
    whenre we have a meaningful value to assign to the object: ideally
    this value should be used in the object initialization. In the above example
    the initialization of the variable <code>i</code> could be moved further down,
    which would immediately uncover the bug:</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  int j;
  cin &gt;&gt; j;
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1; <em>// compiler error: no `i` in scope</em>
    
  int i;  
  cin &gt;&gt; i;  
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1;
}
</pre> 

<p> To be more specific: the above refactoring does not remove the bug, but it turns it into a compiler-detectable one. 
    The programmer now has to fix the typo.</p>

<p> There are more rues, like this, that help turn programmer bugs into diagnosable compiler errors. For instance,
    declare every scalar and POD types <code>const</code>, even if it means using "immediately invoked lambda expressions"
    to cover more complex initialization:
    </p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  <strong>const</strong> int j = [] {
    int j;
    cin &gt;&gt; j;
    return j;
  }();
  cout &lt;&lt; j + 1;
    
  <strong>const</strong> int i = [] {
    int i;
    cin &gt;&gt; i;
    return i;
  }();  
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1;
}
</pre> 

<p> The above rule has the potential to turn inadvertent writes (caused by typos) into compiler errors.</p>

<p> However, all these rules cannot cover all situations, and we cannot turn all programmer bugs
    into compile-time errors. Therefore, next down the line, come pieces of advise like this:</p>
    
<blockquote>Assign the initial value to scalar objects, even if you know that you are going to overwrite it
    before the first read.</blockquote>    

<p>This renders code like the following:</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  int i = 0;     <em>// initial value</em>
  cin &gt;&gt; i;      <em>// initial value overwritten</em>
  cout &lt;&lt; i + 1; <em>// value read</em>
}
</pre> 

<p> This "addition" no longer has any potential to turn programmer bugs into compiler errors. 
    Its goal is different; it is:</p>
    
<blockquote>Should the variable's proper value assignment be skipped, due to a programmer bug,
   we do not get undefined behavior upon the first read. Instead we continue with an unintended value,
   which is not good either, but at least does not immediately cause undefined behavior (even if
   it can trigger undefined behavior later in the program).
   </blockquote>

<p> In order words, it is an attempt to narrow down the scope of unpredictable behavior of the program
    containing a bug.
    </p>   

<p> However, following this advice also comes with a cost: it may prevent the detection of
    the programmer bug by means of symblic evaluation of the program (one form of static analysis).
    Static analyzers cannot understand programmer's intentions, so they cannot diagnose programmer
    bugs directly; but they can diagnose situations of which we could say with high level of certainty
    that they coud never have been the programmer's intention. One such situation is:  
    <p>

<blockquote>It is never the programmer intention to read the value of a scalar object before any
    value has been assigned to the object.
   </blockquote>
   
<p> This rule doesn't say which part of the situation is the source of the bug:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The read of the value in an inappropriate place.</li>
  <li>Failure to perform a write in an approprate place.</li>
</ol>

<p> This rule can only indirectly observes the <em>symptom</em> of a bug. We can be sure that the bug
    is somewhere close to the illegal read, but we do not know where. The static analyzer can now report
    the symptom, and the programmer has a chance to look for the bug.</p>

<p> In order for this type of satic analysis to be successful, one component is required from the programmer:
    the <em>potential</em> to trigger a <em>suspicious</em> event upon a programmr bug. In this case the
    suspicious situation is undefined behavior. Initializing a scalar variable with no value is not undefined behavior.
    It is the read from variable without the preciding write that is undefined behavior. An uninitialized variable
    creates a potential to cause undefined behavior, but this will happen only when there is a programmer bug interacting
    with it. To visualize this:</p>

<blockquote>potential_for_UB + bug + run = UB. (1)</blockquote>

<p> On the other hand we have a similar equation:</p>

<blockquote>potential_for_UB + bug + static_analyzer = static_bug_report. (2)</blockquote>

<p> The advice "assign value (any value) upon initializing a scalar removes term 'potential_for_UB'
    from both equations. In consequence, there is no UB if we run the code, but at the same time
    we may have prevented the static analysis from finding the bug. In contrast, if we do not remove
    'potential_for_UB' and if we are lucky enough that the static analyzer finds the bug for us,
    we can eliminate term 'bug' from both equations. This also prevents undefined behavior when we run the
    program, and additionally we have eliminated the bug.</p>

<p> Of course, removing 'potential_for_UB' is cheaper than removing 'bug', and also running the static analyzer
    does not guarantee that all bugs leading to UB will be found. On the other hand, removing the `UB` from the
    running program while leaving 'bug' in place is not a guarantee that we have prevented all security vulnerabilities
    caused by 'bug'.</p>
    
<p> So there is a technical trade-off to be made here, without an ideal solution, before we can advise with
    clear conscience whether or not to initialize all scalar variables with to-be-overwritten values.
    </p>
    
<p> This proposal offers a solution where we can get both benefits &mdash; static bug detection and no undefined befavior
    &mdash; without doing any technical trade-off.</p> 


<h2><a name="pro">2. The proposal<span class="link">{pro}</span></a></h2>

<p> We propose to add a standard attribute <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code>, which may appertain to a variable or a non-static data member declaration.</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  [[for_overwrite]] int i = 0;  <em>// with initial value</em>
  [[for_overwrite]] int j;      <em>// without initial value</em>
  
  cin &gt;&gt; i &gt;&gt; j;
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; j;
}
</pre> 

<p>Its purpose is to communicate the programmer's intention, which is:</p>

<blockquote> I still intend to perform a write to this variable, after the 
  initialization, before it is read from for the first time, on any execution path.
  If there is an execution path that leads to the read from the variable before a write
  &mdash; other than the write in the initialization &mdash; has been performed,
  this unambiguously indicates a bug in the program.  
  </blockquote>
  
<p> You can use the attribute and still provide the initial value: this is the case for variable <code>i</code>
    in the example. This is the case where you get the best of both worlds: no undefined behavior 
    in the presence of bugs and the potential to generate a suspicious enough event
    that can be reported by the static analyzer in the presence of a bug.</p>

<p> The second case, for variable <code>j</code>, doesn't use the initial value. It still has the potential
    to cause undefined behavior in the presence of a bug. One can use it, if one wishes to skip the redundant
    initialization for other purposes.
    </p>

<p> With this attribute being present, one can introduce a new programming guideine:</p>

<blockquote> If you make a conscious decision to initialize a scalar variable without providing the initial
    value, because you have considered all other alternatives and concluded that this is the best solution,
    use attribute <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code> to indicate this decision.    
  </blockquote> 

<p> A style checker that observes at least one <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code> in a translation unit can
    now safely assume that the programmer uses <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code> effectively and warn about
    all places where a scalar variable is initialized without the initial value and no <code>[[for_overwrite]]</code>
    has been used.</p>  

<p>The attribute can be also appled to non-scalar types with a user provided default constructor:</p>

<pre>
int main()
{
  [[for_overwrite]] std::string s;  <em>// I do not need this value</em>
  
  if (condition())
    cin &gt;&gt; i &gt;&gt; s;
    
  cout &lt;&lt; s;
}
</pre>

<p> A static analyzer can be confused by it and bail out, but if it doesn't it can alert that there is a path that
    does not attempt to modify the original value of <code>s</code>. On the other hand, if the value provided from the
    standard input &mdash; in the non-buggy path &mdash; is an empty string again, it is considered a second read
    and does not cause a static analyzer message.
