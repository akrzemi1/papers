<h1>Minimum contract support</h1>


	<p> In this paper we argue that contract support should be added to the Standard in smaller
	"chunks" than what we had in 
	<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a>.
	There is a risk that controversies like the ones we had in the past may occur again. The really
    said thing about dropping contract support from C++20 was that while some parts were controversial
    and unstable, there was a smaller subset that more-less everyone agreed with, and even this
	subset had to go because of the said controversies.</p>	
	
	<p>We indicate this smaller subset, and propose to add it as the first step, which we hope,
	will be accepted smoothly. Once this is done, we can ad the other missing features, but this time
    without the risk of removing the smaller and stable subset.	</p>
	
	<p>We also show that the smaller subset is universally useful to various groups of programmers
	and a complete small feature (a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP), and does not prevent
	any of the remaining features from being added in next phases, potentially in the same 
	release cycle.</p>
	
	

<h2><a name="analysis">Analysis</a></h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2076r0.html">[P2076r0]</a> 
    lists the points the disagreements about the previous incarnation of contracts design:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>continuation mode,</li>
    <li>build levels,</li>
    <li>global toggles aka external remapping controls,</li>
    <li>literal semantics aka in-source controls,</li>
    <li>assumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The claim we make here is that if we eliminated all these, or reduced significantly, 
	we would get a feature that is still a coherent and useful. The value in preventing bugs
	and enforcing program correcness comes from</p>
	
	<ol type="a">
    <li>being able to express preconditions, postconditions (and similar constraints) as C++ predicates, and</li>
    <li>being able to turn them into runtime-checks: all or none is sufficient granularity.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This is, of course, too little to handle all practical use cases, but gives a solution that would
	benefit many developers initially. Even this small subset may take long to bake. For instance, 
	we believe that the question of compiling different TUs with different build modes (even if these modes are
	"on" and "off") may require more elaboration in the Standard than just saying "is conditionally supported":
	we may want to narrow the scope of what the users can expect of this conditional support. Some natural
	expectations of users may be unimplementable, like: if I compiled a library with contract checking disabled
	but it has some inline functions in header files, are these functions' contracts also not runtime-checked?</p>
	
	
	<p>Our criteria for selecting the MVP are:</p>
	
	<ol type="1">
    <li>Making it small.</li>
    <li>Making it useful for as many programmers as possible.</li>
	<li>Making it uncontroversial.</li>
	<li>Making it open for adding missing features later.</li>
    </ol>
	
	
	<p>In the reminder of the paper we elaborate about the individual features
	that would be supported or not in the proposed MVP.</p>



<h3><a name="analysis.going_in">What goes in?</a></h3>


<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.declarations">Contract declarations</a></h4>

    <p>The most important thing is the ability to express the predicates as compiler-checked C++ expressions.
    First, it is information for humans. If "autocomplete" in my IDE gives me a hint that includes a precondition
    it can already save me from planting a bug. Second, even if there weren't any Standard way to force the compiler
    to inject a runtime check, compilers would at least have a chance to do it in a non-standard way, because they
	would know what to generate the checks from. Also, some forrm of static analysis can already be performed
	if preconditions and postconditions can be expressed in a forma and standardized way. This addition alone 
	would already satisfy many users.
    </p>

	
<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.on_off">Turning on and off all runtime checks</a></h4>

    <p>Another MVP requirement manifests in the following set of essential, but self-contradictory requirements.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Because my program is safety-critical, I must have a guarantee that program never continues after a
        contract predicate is violated.</li>
        <li>Because my game is performance-critical, I must have a guarantee that not a single runtime instruction
        is generated from my contract declarations.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This suggests that there needs to be at least one two-state toggle somewhere in the compiler that toggles between:
    "add no code based on contract declarations" and "runtime-check predicates and abort on failure." A similar mechanism
    is already present in C++: <code>NDEBUG</code> and <code>assert</code>, so we would not be adding any new problems
    than those already present in C++.</p>
    
    <p>How will that work if I want checks disabled in one third-party library, but have them enabled im my code?
    The important part of the answer is: because we are adding nothing that compilers don't already do, we can let them
    continue address the problem in the same way that they did before. Typically, third-party vendors will offer
    two versions of their library: Debug and Release. Alternatively, the programmer may have to recompile the library when
       she decides to turn off the runtime checks. Another option is to control this per single file or component using macros.
    C++ modules might enable a new way of dealing with thi problem. For MVP it is enough to do what 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a> offered: only require of
    implementations that they allow building <em>all</em> translation unit in the same mode. Any finer-grained control
    is implementation defined.</p>
    
    <p>There is one aspect of contract declarations that makes them unlike C-<code>assert()</code>s, though:
    the latter cannot appear in function declaraions. Because of this, saying to compiler vendors "do wht you are now
    doing for <code>assert()</code>s" may not be enough. Hopefully, this can be fixed for the MVP.</p>
    
    
<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.logging">Minimum control of how contract violations are reported</a></h4>


    <p>Should programmers be in control how the logging of a failed contract runtime check is performed? 
    Again, for the MVP, we think that 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a> got that right:
    implemenations are not required to offer this, but they can if they choose to. Again, we do not specify how they do it,
    but we specify how they must not do it: there must be no function like <code>set_broken_contract()</code>.
    This is for safety reasons. Even if this last requirement cannot be imposed in practice, at least it sends a clear message
    about potential vulnerability.</p>
    
    <p>Next thing, we believe that communication with contract violation handler via <code>std::contract_violation</code>
    should stay in. There were no controversies around it, and it is a necessary piece to enable a reasonably portable
    way of installing a custom handler. If not now, then in the future.</p>
    

<h3><a name="analysis.stayng_out">What stays out (for now)?</a></h3>



<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.continuation">Not aborting upon failed runtime check for certain contact statements</a></h4>
    


    <p>The use case that continuation mode was trying to address was when an author of a third-party library
    puts a runtime-checkable contract statement in the place where conract already existed but didn't use to be 
    enforced via runtime checks. When doing this there is arisk that in user's program the function is called 
    out of contract, but the program still works fine because this violation is benign. It would be unacceptable
    to turn a benign violation into <code>std::abort()</code>. So what is needed it a way to runtime-check the 
    condition, log it, but let the program continue.</p>
    
    <p>Continuation mode didn't achieve this goal, as there was no way to tell apart the new "experimental" 
    or "review" contract declarations from the old reliable ones. So, all of them had to be enabled for continuation,
    which was not acceptable a solution.</p>
    
    <p>Experience with these "log only" contract chesks comes from Bloomberg 
    (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1332r0.txt">[P1332r0]</a>), but in these case, it is the
    contract checks that are marked as "log only". So, if this use case is supported in the future, it will have a 
    different incarnation than continuation mode.</p>
    

    
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.levels">Contract levels</a></h4>

    <p>We want to keep contract levels, such as <code>default</code> and <code>audit</code>, out of the MVP.
    We acknowledge the need to indicate "this predicate is more expensive to evaluate than the function it protects",
    but the design of this feature has flaws, and given that it is one of these "experimental" features, never implemented
    in other languages, there is a risk that we would be doing it wrong.
    </p>
    
    <p>Here is an objection. Consider a function template:</p>
    
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>
    
    <p>The question is, is <code>p.pred()</code> far more expensive to evaluate than <code>p.op()</code>? The answer is,
    it depends on <code>T</code>. And we do not know all <code>T</code>s that our function template will be instantiated
    with. Even if there is a metafunction:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr bool pred_more_expensive_than_op = <em>/* ... */</em>;</pre>

    <p>How do we use it, given that the only option is to provide label <code>audit</code>? Should we provide two 
    overloads only to put different label?</p>
    
  <pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}

template &lt;typename T&gt;
  requires pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre <strong>audit</strong>: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>

<p>Additionlly, people who want to really make use of levels, understood as how expensive the predicate is compared to function body,
will soon discover that only two or three levels will never suffice. And something like integral level needs to be used anyway. 
We believe that this topic has not been sufficiently explored.</p>

<p>Anyone who needs the audit level, can emulate it atop of the MVP:</p>
    
<pre>// first the framework
constexpr bool audit_mode_enabled = /* set to true in Debug mode */;

consteval bool audit() { return !audit_mode_enabled; }
consteval bool audit(bool enable) { return enable &amp;&amp; !audit_mode_enabled; }

// now the library interface
void fun(Thing * p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: audit() || p->is_jinxed()]];</pre>
  
    <p>The conditional audit level is also possible:</p>
    
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
  requires pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: audit(pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;) || p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>

    <p>Another problem with levels, altough not verbosely contested, was he choice of syntax. 
    First problem was that as secondary information as "level" was introduced before the primary
    information: the predicate. Second, the position of contract level conflicted with the return 
    object name, which effectively made <code>audit</code> and <code>axiom</code> context-sensitive
    keywords:</p>  
    
<pre>audit_t select_appropriate_audit()
  [[post audit audit_: audit_ != 0]];
</pre>

    <p>The only reason the underscore is used in the return object name is because the most 
    adequate identifier &mdash; <code>audit</code> &mdash; cannot be used in this context. 
    The trend to put any meta-information about the contract statement before the colon would
    become even more troublesome when in the future we decided to add additional parameters:
    capturing the state of variables upon entry (old-of) or roles.</p>
   
    <p>In contrast, if we do not add levels in MVP, we get an opportunity to reintroduce them
    later with a different syntax, for instance:</p>

<pre>audit_t select_appropriate_audit(int id)
  [[pre: is_appropriate(id); audit]]
  [[post audit: audit != 0; audit]];
</pre>

    <p>Here, the semicolon separates the predicate and introduced indentifiers from meta-information,
    so in the postcondition the first <code>audit</code> is an identifier and only the last one
    represents the level. Similarly, once the meta-information is moved aside, this leaves room for old-of variables.
    This could look like this:</p>
    
<pre>int fun(Person* p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: p-&gt;is_engaged(); audit]]
  [[post old_age = p-&gt;age(), age: age == old_age]];</pre>
 
<p>or like this:</p>
 
<pre>int fun(Person* p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: p-&gt;is_engaged(); audit]]
  [[with: old_age = p-&gt;age()]]
  [[post age: age == old_age]];</pre>
   
  
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.build_levels">global toggles aka external remapping controls</a></h4>


    <p>If there are no levels in contract declarations in the MVP, there is no need for having build
    levels either, other than on/off switch.</p>
    
 

<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.literal_semantics">literal semantics aka in-source controls</a></h4> 


    <p>They were never in the draft, but the MVP leaves room for them to be added in subsequent steps.
    Not adding them initially buys us time to design the solution for controlling code generation
    for individual contract statements that would be acceptable to the majority, and tested in practice.
    They were advertised as low-level building blocks that are only useful when combined with macros.
    Maybe if we have gained more time we can design something that does not require this intrmediate step.</p>


 
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.assumptions">"assumptions" or injected facts</a></h4>
 
 
    <p>Some use cases for injected facts have been offloaded by 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1774r3.pdf">[P1774r3]</a>.
    What remains is the use case that we could call, "just turn all my contract violations into UB in hope
    of performance gains." If someone is determined to have them, they
    can be emulated by installing a custom contract violation handler that looks like this:</p>

<pre>void adventurous_handler(std::contract_violation const&amp;)
{
  *static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(nullptr) = 0; <em>// this UB is special-cased by compilers</em>
}</pre>
 
    <p>We said earleir that the support for custom violation handlers is optional, 
    but so is the entire ability to optimize code based on UB from broken contracts.
    Some compilers already treat null pointer dereference in a different way than any
    other UB: they apply special code transformations assuming that null pointers are 
    never dereferenced. In the same way, such compilers, in special dangerous modes,
    can treat installing a handler that dereferences a null pointer as a special case.     
    </p>


<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.axioms"><code>axiom</code>-level contract statements</a></h4>


    <p>One of the use cases for contract statements with level <code>axiom</code> in 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/P0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a>
    was to declare predicates that are well understood, but whose body cannot be expressed in C++, 
    such as reachability for iterators. We also propose to eliminate it from the MVP. We acknowledge
    that this use case is important, and we want ultimately to provide support for it. However, 
    we believe that omitting it still leaves a viable and useful feature for multiple groups of
    users, and at the same time gives us time to explore the design space a bit deeper. For instance,
    <a href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P2176R0.html">[P2176r0]</a> proposes an alternative
    design where it is function declarations that are marked as inexpressible rather than each single
    contract declaration that uses such function.</p>
