<h1>Contract Support: Defining the Minimum Viable Feature Set</h1>


    <p>We observe that "C++20 contracts" consisted of two parts. 
	One part was clear, well understood, widely agreed upon, and useful 
	to various groups of C++ users. The other part rose a lot of controversies
	for various reasons and ultimately led to the removal of the entire feature.
	</p>
	
	<p>In paper <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2114r0.html"
    >[P2114r0]</a> we have indicated the use cases that we believe represent the 
	uncontroversial part of "C++20 contracts". If only them would be supported in C++
	it would already be a huge positive impact on many diverse groups of users. 
	In this paper we provide the rationale for our choice. We show that our selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>is big enough to be called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and get support of the majority of C++ programmers,</li>
	<li>does not require controversial design, or features not already implemented in other languages,</li>
	<li>does not prevent the addition of any of the remaining features of "C++20 contracts", or other discussed alternatives, in subsequent stages.</li>
	</ul>
	
	

<h2><a name="analysis">Analysis</a></h2>


	<p>In this document we use term <em>C++20 contracts</em> to refer to contract support
	facilities in C++ Standard draft just before the removal: 
	<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/n4820.pdf">[N4820]</a>.</p>
	
    <p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2076r0.html">[P2076r0]</a> 
    lists the points the disagreements about the previous incarnation of contracts design:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>continuation mode,</li>
    <li>build levels,</li>
    <li>global toggles aka external remapping controls,</li>
    <li>literal semantics aka in-source controls,</li>
    <li>assumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The claim we make here is that if we eliminated from C++ contracts the use cases handled by 
	the above features, or at least reduced them significanly, the reminder would still be a complete
	feature that would offer a great help in enforcing program correctness. The value in preventing bugs
	and enforcing program correcness comes from</p>
	
	<ol type="a">
    <li>being able to express preconditions, postconditions (and similar constraints) as C++ predicates, and</li>
    <li>being able to turn them into runtime-checks: all or none is sufficient granularity.</li>
    </ol>
	
	<p>In the reminder of the paper we elaborate on the features of MVP and show how they map on use cases
	nominated in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2114r0.html"
    >[P2114r0]</a>. We also show how the support for the remaining use cases can be added atop of MVP
    in subsequent phases of adding contract support to C++.</p>



<h3><a name="analysis.going_in">What goes in?</a></h3>


<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.declarations">Contract declarations</a></h4>

    <p>The most important thing is the ability to express the predicates in function declarations 
	as compiler-checked C++ expressions. This is uncontroversial. It is also essential if we 
	want the compiler to generate run-time checks from contract declarations. In fact, this feature alone 
	would already satisfy many users.
    </p>

	
<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.on_off">Turning on and off all runtime checks</a></h4>

    <p>Another MVP requirement manifests in the following set of essential, but self-contradictory requirements.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Because my program is safety-critical, I must have a guarantee that program never continues after a
        contract predicate is violated.</li>
        <li>Because my game is performance-critical, I must have a guarantee that not a single runtime instruction
        is generated from my contract declarations.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This suggests that there needs to be at least one two-state toggle somewhere in the compiler that toggles between:
    "only syntax-check" and "inject run-time checks." For MVP it is enough to do what 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a> offered: only require of
    implementations that they allow building <em>all</em> translation units in the same mode. Any finer-grained control
    is implementation defined.</p>
    
    
    
<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.logging">Minimum control of how contract violations are reported</a></h4>


    <p>Should programmers be in control how the logging of a failed contract runtime check is performed? 
    Again, for the MVP, we think that 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a> got that right:
    implemenations are not required to offer this, but they can if they choose to.</p>
    
	

<h3><a name="analysis.stayng_out">What stays out (for now)?</a></h3>



<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.continuation">Continuation after failed run-time check</a></h4>
    


    <p>The use case that continuation mode was trying to address was when an author of a third-party library
    puts a runtime-checkable contract statement in the place where conract already existed but didn't use to be 
    enforced via runtime checks. When doing this there is arisk that in user's program the function is called 
    out of contract, but the program still works fine because this violation is benign. It would be unacceptable
    to turn a benign violation into <code>std::abort()</code>. So what is needed it a way to runtime-check the 
    condition, log it, but let the program continue.</p>
    
    <p>Continuation mode didn't achieve this goal, as there was no way to tell apart the new "experimental" 
    or "review" contract declarations from the old reliable ones. So, all of them had to be enabled for continuation,
    which was not acceptable a solution.</p>
    
    <p>Experience with these "log only" contract chesks comes from Bloomberg 
    (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1332r0.txt">[P1332r0]</a>), but in these case, it is the
    contract checks that are marked as "log only". So, if this use case is supported in the future, it will have a 
    different incarnation than continuation mode.</p>
    

    
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.levels">Contract levels</a></h4>

    <p>We want to keep contract levels, such as <code>default</code> and <code>audit</code>, out of the MVP.
    We acknowledge the need to indicate "this predicate is more expensive to evaluate than the function it protects",
    but the design of this feature has flaws, and given that it is one of these "experimental" features, never implemented
    in other languages, there is a risk that we would be doing it wrong. Main objections are:
    </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Syntax cannot handle templates where level may depend on template arguments.</li>
	<li>Two levels (or even three) cannot be enough.</li>
	<li>Levels is not enough to convey essential meta information.</li>
	<li>Syntax is not extensible.</li>
	<li>Syntax is uncomfortable.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <p>We will explain these objections in more detail. First, templates. Consider a function template:</p>
    
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>
    
    <p>The question is, is <code>p.pred()</code> far more expensive to evaluate than <code>p.op()</code>? The answer is,
    it depends on <code>T</code>. And we do not know all <code>T</code>s that our function template will be instantiated
    with. Even if there was a metafunction:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr bool pred_more_expensive_than_op = <em>/* ... */</em>;</pre>

    <p>How do we use it, given that the only option is to provide label <code>audit</code>? Should we provide two 
    overloads only to put different labels?</p>
    
  <pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}

template &lt;typename T&gt;
  requires pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre <strong>audit</strong>: p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>

	<p>Second, people who want to really make use of levels, understood as how expensive the predicate is compared to function body,
	will soon discover that only two or three levels will never suffice. And something like integral level needs to be used anyway. 
	We believe that this topic has not been sufficiently explored.</p>

	<p>Anyone who needs the audit level, can emulate it atop of the MVP:</p>
    
<pre><em>// first the framework for audit checks</em>
constexpr bool audit_mode_enabled = /* set to true in Debug mode */;

consteval bool audit() { return !audit_mode_enabled; }
consteval bool audit(bool enable) { return enable &amp;&amp; !audit_mode_enabled; }

<em>// library is using the framework</em>
void fun(Thing * p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: audit() || p->is_jinxed()]];</pre>
  
    <p>The conditional audit level is also possible:</p>
    
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
  requires pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;
void fun(T&amp; p)
  [[pre: audit(pred_more_expensive_than_op&lt;T&gt;) || p.pred()]]
{
  p.op();
}</pre>

	<p>Third, levels are a subset of a more general concept: a hint to the compiler that instructs
	what code should be generated from the contract statement; a hint applied with the granularity
	of a single contract statement. It is clear that levels will not cover all the essential use
	cases for per-contract-statement hints. One obvious example is the "review"-role annotation.
	It is likely that we will need more in the future, but we may not be able to add them because
	of the syntax constraints described below.</p>
	
    <p>Another problem with levels, altough not verbosely contested, was he choice of syntax. 
    First problem was that the secondary hint (level) was introduced before the primary
    information: the predicate. Second, the position of contract level conflicted with the return 
    object name, which effectively made <code>audit</code> and <code>axiom</code> context-sensitive
    keywords:</p>  
    
<pre>audit_t select_appropriate_audit()
  [[post audit audit_: audit_ != 0]];
</pre>

    <p>The only reason the underscore is used in the return object name is because the most 
    adequate identifier &mdash; <code>audit</code> &mdash; cannot be used in this context. 
	If a new hint is needed in the future, we may not be able to find a good name, because
	we would be at risk of breaking user code who may be using the name already.
    Also, the trend to put any compiler hint as context-sensitive keywords before the colon would
    become even more troublesome when in the future we decided to add additional feature:
    capturing the state of variables upon entry (old-of).</p>
   
    <p>In contrast, if we do not add levels in MVP, we get an opportunity to reintroduce them
    later with a different syntax, for instance:</p>

<pre>audit_t select_appropriate_audit(int id)
  [[pre: is_appropriate(id); audit]]
  [[post audit: audit != 0; audit]];
</pre>

    <p>Here, the semicolon separates the predicate and introduced indentifiers from meta-information,
    so in the postcondition the first <code>audit</code> is an identifier and only the last one
    represents the level. Similarly, once the meta-information is moved aside, this leaves room for old-of variables.
    This could look like this:</p>
    
<pre>int fun(Person* p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: p-&gt;is_engaged(); audit]]
  [[post old_age = p-&gt;age(), age: age == old_age]];</pre>
 
<p>or like this:</p>
 
<pre>int fun(Person* p)
  [[pre: p != nullptr]]
  [[pre: p-&gt;is_engaged(); audit]]
  [[with: old_age = p-&gt;age()]]
  [[post age: age == old_age]];</pre>
   
  
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.build_levels">Global toggles aka external remapping controls</a></h4>


    <p>If there are no levels in contract declarations in the MVP, there is no need for having build
    levels either, other than on/off switch.</p>
    
 

<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.literal_semantics">Literal semantics aka in-source controls</a></h4> 


    <p>They were never in the draft, but the MVP leaves room for them to be added in subsequent steps.
    Not adding them initially buys us time to design the solution for controlling code generation
    for individual contract statements that would be acceptable to the majority, and tested in practice.
    They were advertised as low-level building blocks that are only useful when combined with macros.
    Maybe if we have gained more time we can design something that does not require this intrmediate step.</p>


 
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.assumptions">Assumptions or injected facts</a></h4>
 
 
	<p>There were two use cases for assumptions recorded:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Used very sparingly and cautiously, where one injected fact can dramatically affect program performance and
	    counterbalance any testing costs or risks.</li>
	<li>"Just treat all contract declarations as injected facts and let's see if it improves performance."</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>We do not consider the first one as a use case for contract support framework. And it is now
	pursued as an independent feture in 
	<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1774r3.pdf">[P1774r3]</a>.
	Even if at some point EWG or SG21 were to decide that this use case shoule be added to contract support 
	framework, the MVP leaves that door open: this could be a meta-information appended to a contract statement.
	</p>
	
	<p>Regarding the second use case, although we do not consider it part of MVP, we observe that 
	the MVP would already support it with the help of vendor-specific extensions. One would just
	have to install a custom contract violation handler that dereferences a null pointer inside.
	On a compiler that (1) allows replacing a contract violation handler and (2) recognizes 
	null pointer dereference as special case of UB this would do the trick. No additional language 
	support is required.</p>
	


<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.axioms">Indicating inexpressible predicates</a></h4>


    <p>One of the use cases for contract statements with level <code>axiom</code> in 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/P0542r5.html">[P0542r5]</a>
    was to declare predicates that are well understood, but whose body cannot be expressed in C++, 
    such as reachability for iterators. We propose this be added after the initial MVP. We acknowledge
    that this use case is important, and we want ultimately to provide support for it. However, 
    we believe that omitting it from MVP still leaves a viable and useful feature for multiple groups of
    users, and at the same time gives us time to explore the design space a bit deeper. For instance,
    <a href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P2176R0.html">[P2176r0]</a> proposes an alternative
    design where it is function declarations that are marked as inexpressible rather than each single
    contract declaration that uses such function.</p>
 
 
<h2><a name="next">Next steps</a></h2>
 
 
	<p>Does thus defined MVP allow the use case of big third party library vendors that want
	to cautiously introduce new sets of contract statements without the risk of breaking
	their users' porgrams? No, it does not. Do we consider this use case unimportant? 
	By no means. We want to ultimately provide a solution that will cover this use case.
	But we do not know how to that yet, whereas we already know how to handle the use
	case of application developers. We do not want the use case that we know how to handle 
	and that has a wide consensus to be be held hostage by the part that still needs
	some baking.</p>
