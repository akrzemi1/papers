<h1>Contract Support: Defining the Minimum Viable Feature Set</h1>


  <p>We observe that "C++20 contracts" consisted of two parts. 
	One part was clear, well understood, widely agreed upon, and useful 
	to various groups of C++ users. The other part rose a lot of controversies
	for various reasons and ultimately led to the removal of the entire feature.
	</p>
	
	<p>In paper <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2114r0.html"
    >[P2114r0]</a> we have listed a subset of use cases we believe represent useful improvements
  to the language, offer an incalculable positive value for most users, and reflect the
  uncontroversial part of "C++20 contracts". In this paper we provide the rationale for our
  choice. We wish to show that our selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>is big enough to be called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and get support of the majority of C++ programmers;</li>
	<li class="revision">is small enough that we can make it ready in a relatively short period of time;</li>
	<li>does not require controversial design, or features not already implemented in other languages;</li>
	<li>does not prevent the addition of any of the remaining features of "C++20 contracts", or other discussed alternatives, in subsequent stages.</li>
	</ul>

<h2><a name="model">1. Design Objectives and Programming Model</a></h2>

<h3><a name="model.objectives">1.1. Design Objectives</a></h3>

<p> Our primary objective is to enable programmers to <strong>improve safety</strong> of their programs, by the following means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>detecting bugs,</li>
  <li>enabling predictable behavior in the face of such bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p> Secondarily, we aim at leaving the door open for other objectives in the future, such as supporting contract-based code transformations, as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they fit into our programming model,</li>
  <li>they do not compromise our ability to satisfy the primary objective.</li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="model.model">1.2. The Programming Model</a></h3>

<h4><a name="model.model.bugdef">1.2.1. Declaring criteria for bugs</a></h4>

<p>The contract support facility that we propose enables programmers to declare in the source code that
   certain values of objects observed at certain times necessarily indicate a bug somewhere in the program. 
	 </p>

<pre>
T&amp; Container::get(int i)
  [[pre: i &gt;= 0]]       <em>// precondition</em>
  [[pre: i &lt; size()]]   <em>// precondition</em>
{
  [[assert: buffer_ != nullptr]];  <em>// block-scope invariant</em>
  return buffer_[i];
}
</pre>

<p>Here, the two preconditions specify that whenever function <code>Container::get</code> is invoked, just before its execution, 
   if either of expressions <code>i &gt;= 0</code> or <code>i &lt; size()</code> were to evaluate to <code>false</code>,
	 it would indicate a bug in the program. Class author can make that declaration because she understands the human-to-human
	 class/function contract: that the <code>int</code> value passed to this function represents an abstract notion of an <em>index</em>
	 in a container.
	 </p>

<p> The assertion inside the function body indicates that when control reaches this statement, if expression <code>buffer_ != nullptr</code>
     were to evaluate to <code>false</code>, it would indicate a bug in the program. The class author can make that declaration, 
		 because she knows the purpose for which she put pointer <code>buffer_</code> as a class member, and she knows the rules based
		 on which it will change value.
    </p>		 

<p> In either case, the programmer has a knowledge about the program that the machines do not. By making these declarations
    machines obtain part of this knowledge: they can now precisely determine that a program has a bug. 
		</p>

<p> Different machines can make different use of these contract annotations. Static analyzers can perform a symbolic evaluation
    of the program and determine if there exist combinations of external input that lead to any of the contract annotations producing 
		value <code>false</code>.
		</p>

<p> Compilers, under special flags, can inject runtime-checks in place of these declarations, which would make the above function 
    behave as if it was defined so:
		</p>


<pre>T&amp; Container::get(int i)
{
  if ((i &gt;= 0) == false) { std::cerr &lt;&lt; violation("i &gt;= 0"); std::abort(); }
  if ((i &lt; size()) == false) { std::cerr &lt;&lt; violation("i &lt; size()"); std::abort(); }
  if ((buffer_ != nullptr) == false) { std::cerr &lt;&lt; violation("buffer_ != nullptr"); std::abort(); }
  return buffer_[i];
}
</pre>

<p> Tools can do these things only because the programmer gave them this additional information about what constitutes a bug.</p>


<h4><a name="model.model.control">1.2.2. Controlling the tools</a></h4>

<p>Tools are resource-limited. In order for them to make an effective use of contract annotations, the programmer or someone else needs
to be able to instruct them to treat different contract annotations diffeently. </p>

<p>In case of static analyzer, a programmer may want to say, "just take for granted that contract declarations flagged with <code>checked</code>
   are always satisfied, and only check for potential vioations in the remaining ones."</p>

<p>In case of compiler injecting runtime checks, a programmer might want to say, "inject checks only for contract annotations
   flagged as <code>critical</code>."</p>


<h4>Other applications of the model</h4>

<p>Technically, it is possible to use contract annotations for purposes different than bug detection. 
One such notable purpose is code transformations that guarantee to leave the bug-free programs unchanged 
and possibly optimized, while at the same time arbitrarily changing the semantics of programs that have 
bugs diagnosable through contract annotations. This is sometimes (imprecisely) referred to as contract-based optimizations. </p>

<p>Contract-based optimizations are compatible with our programming model (users declare what they consider a bug, 
and tools make use of these declarations); but concerns have been expressed about the potential interference with our primary goal: 
improving safety. Every useful program in practice does contain bugs, and often programs can behave reasonably 
well even in the face of these bugs. Allowing contract-based optimizations may turn programs that behave reasonably
in the face of bugs into programs that behave unreasonably in the face of bugs. Wherever it can be demonstrated that 
any secondary goals are in a direct and an irreconcilable conflict with our primary goal, we commit to resolving 
any such conflict in favor of our primary goal: improving safety.</p>

<h2><a name="analysis">2. Analysis</a></h2>


	<p>In this document we use the term <em>C++20 Contracts</em> to refer to contract support
	facilities in C++ Standard draft just before the removal &mdash;
    
	  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/n4820.pdf">[N4820]</a>
      (which is effectively equivalent to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542R5]</a>)
      &mdash;
      
          as well as pieces of the associated proposals seen by EWG that had support in polling, such as: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1290r3.pdf">[P1290R3]</a></li>

    <p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2076r0.html">[P2076r0]</a> 
    lists the points of disagreement about the previous incarnation of contracts design:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Continuation Mode</li>
    <li>Build Levels</li>
    <li>Global Toggles (also known as: external remapping controls)</li>
    <li>Literal Semantics (also known as: in-source controls)</li>
    <li>Assumptions</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="revision">We observe that all these features fall into category "controlling the tools" in our model.</span>
		We claim that if we eliminated the use cases for <span class="revision">fine-grained tool control</span>,
		the remainder would still <span class="revision">satisfy a huge, consistent and well understood demand. 
		Addressing it would </span>be a valuable and usable feature that would offer a great help in enforcing program
    correctness. The value in preventing bugs and enforcing program correctness comes from being able to:</p>
	
	<ol>
    <li>Just express preconditions, postconditions, and assertions as C++ predicates. <span class="revision">This enables a portable language
		    for communicating what constitutes a bug. This information can be consumed by many different tools as well as human programmers.</span></li>
    <li>Transform them into runtime-checks at an all-or-none granularity, leaving open the design of finer control to future work.
    		<span class="revision">This enables the guarantee that program will never continue after detecting a bug defined by the contract annotations.</span></li>
  </ol>
	
	<p>In the reminder of the paper we elaborate on the features of MVP and show how they are motivated
  by the use cases nominated in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2114r0.html"
    >[P2114r0]</a>. We also discuss how the support for the remaining use cases can be added atop of MVP
    in subsequent phases.</p>



<h3><a name="analysis.going_in">2.1. Features in MVP</a></h3>


<p>We selected the minimal use cases to allow the widest benefit for the most
general section of users, without resorting to known points of contention. We had
in mind a simple feature that consisted of the <span class="revision">C++20</span> Contract syntax,
a single build option to enable or disable checks, and a (conditionally) user-definable violation handler
 that is invoked when runtime-enabled checks are violated.</p>



<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.declarations">2.1.1. Contract declarations</a></h4>

    <p>The most important thing is the ability to express the predicates in function declarations 
	as compiler-checked C++ expressions. This is uncontroversial. This enables: </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>compiler to report type-system errors from incorrectly spelled constraints</li>
    <li>generation of run-time code &mdash; such as contract checks, or unit tests</li>
    <li>annotation aware static analysis</li>
    </ul>
   
		<p class="revision">The contract annotations look like this:</p>

<pre class="revision">int Accumlator::running_max(int i)
  [[pre: i >= 0]]     <em>// precondition</em>
  [[post r: r >= 0]]  <em>// postcondition</em>
{
  [[assert: stored_ >= 0]];  <em>// block-scope invariant</em>
  return stored_ = std::max(i, stored_);
}	
</pre>
		
		<p class="revision">Compared to C++20 contracts, there is no room for contract-levels: <code>default</code>,
		<code>audit</code> or <code>axiom</code>. Also no room for "literal semantics", such as <code>ignore</code>.
		We only have a predicate and, in the case of postconditions, the name of return value.</p>
		
    <p>In fact, this feature alone would already satisfy many users.</p>

<h4><a name="analysis.going_in.on_off">2.1.2. Turning on and off all runtime checks</a></h4>

    <p>We believe it is essential that we meet two somewhat contradictory requirements:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>A guarantee that some action is taken whenever a contract is violated</li>
        <li>A guarantee that there is no runtime overhead for encoded contracts</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The former is a correctness requirement, and the latter is performance requirement 
    (after assurance &mdash; further discussion about assurance can be found in 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1517r0.html#background">[P1517R0]</a>).
    </p>
    
    <p>This suggests that there needs to be at least some control, <span class="revision">at build time, over what
       effect contract annotations have on the final executable.</span>  For the MVP we suggest a single flag which
      turns checking "on" or "off", where:</p>

    <ul class="revision">
      <li>"Off" requires that predicates in contract annotations are suntax-checked but otherwise do not affect the resulting executable.</li>
      <li>"On" requires that runtime checks are inserted in place of contract annotations. When any such predicate check returns <code>false</code>,
           violation handler is invoked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a subset of what
      <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html">[P0542R5]</a>
      offered, and should come with similar caveats that that proposal had for
      build modes &mdash; where mixing modes is only conditionally supported.</p>

    <p>Finer-grained control and additional semantics to failed checks would be
      left to extensions and future proposals. </p>

<h3><a name="analysis.stayng_out">2.2. C++20 Contracts Features not in MVP</a></h3>

	<p class="revision">This section lists use cases that are essential for a contract programming facility,
		were present in some form in C++20 Contracts, but we decided to leave them out for the MVP.</p>


<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.continuation">2.2.1. Continuation after failed run-time check</a></h4>
    
	<p class="revision">The ability to control whether a program is halted after a violation handler is called: 
	    whether for all runtime-checked contract annotations, or for a subset of them. This would address 
			<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1995r0.html#sdev.maturity"><code>sdev.maturity</code></a>

    <p>This ability can be introduced on top of MVP as secondary annotations on individual contract annotations
    		(as described in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1332r0.txt"
        >[P1332R0]</a>), and additionally requiring more build modes.
			</p>
    
    
<h4><a name="analysis.stayng_out.levels">2.2.2. Controlling run-time checks based on cost</a></h4>

    <p class="revision">The ability to declare the relative cost of runtime-evaluating the predicate inside the contract annotation against the runtime cost 
    of evaluating the function that the contract annotation appertains to would address use cases:</p>
		
		<ul class="revision">

		</ul>
    
		<p>Contract levels, such as <code>default</code> and <code>audit</code>, tried to address this,
    but the design of this feature had flaws:
    </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>The proposed syntax cannot handle templates where the level may depend on template arguments.</li>
	<li>Two levels (or even three) cannot be enough.</li>
	<li>Levels is not enough to convey essential meta information.</li>
	<li>Syntax is not extensible.</li>
	<li>Syntax is uncomfortable.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <p>This functionality can be introduced on top of MVP as annotations indicating how expensive a contract statement is relative to

  <p><span class="revision">The best explored use case for this is when there is a single fact injected into a program that is known

		the performance characteristics of a program from unacceptably slow to realy fast. In that case the risk of corrupting the program 
		is justified. This use case</span> can be handled by a separate feature, such as

		users can stick to vendor-specific extensions, such as <code>__builtin_assume()</code></span>.</p>
  
  <p class="revision">The other use case is when all, or a group, of contract annotations is turned simultaneously into multiple injected facts,
	   without previous knowledge if and to what extent this might improve program performance. Turnig literally all contract annotations into
		 injected facts is possible if a programmer installs a custom violation handler containing <code>__builtin_unreachable()</code>.</p>
		 
	<p class="revision">The remaining use case for turning a selected group of contract annotations into injected facts could in principle 
	   be achieved in the future by introducing another second-level annotation in contract annotations.</p>

<h3><a name="analysis.compatible">2.3. Other Use-Cases Compatibe with Our Model</a></h3>


<p>This section lists use cases not addressed in the MVP that are compatible with our progrmming model that could be added in th future.</p>


<h4><a name="analysis.compatible.grouping">2.3.1. Grouping the annotations</a></h4>

<p>The ability to organize contract annotations into groups woud address a lot of use cases. This could be acheved by assigning tags to individual contract annotations.
Later, upon assembling the entire program, the person in charge could instruct the tool (e.g., compiler) to treat contract annotations with a given tag differently 
than contract annotations with differnt tags. This way desired semantics could be assigned to groups of contract annotations (rather than to individual annotations or to
all annotaiotn).

<h4><a name="analysis.compatible.more_annotations">2.3.2. More contract annotations</a></h4>

<p>There are more contrct annotations that we could add, which would give even more information to tools looking for bugs.</p>

<p>One, class invariants:</p>

<pre>class TimeOfDay
{
  int minutes_;  <em>// since midnight</em>
  [[assert: minutes_ &gt; 0]];    <em>// class invariant</em>
  [[assert: minutes_ &lt; 1440]]; <em>// class invariant</em>
	
pubic:

    [[pre: mins &gt;= 0]]
    [[pre: mins &lt; 1440]];
		
  int minutes() const
    [[post r: r &gt;= 0]]
    [[post r: r &lt; 1440]];
};</pre>

<h4><a name="analysis.compatible.oldof">2.3.3. Referring to old values of modified objects</a></h4>

<p>The ability in function postconditions to refer to values of objects observed at the point the function was entered. For instance, <code>.push_back()</code> 
postcondition could state that the value of <code>.size()</code> upon exit from function shoul be greater y one than the value of <code>.size()</code> upon
entering the function.</p>

<p>There is a number of ways the syntax for contract annotations can be extended in the future to accomodate this. Here we list two possibilities:<p>

<pre>void container::push_back(T const&amp; v)
  [[post: size() == oldof(size()) + 1]];
  
void container::push_back(T const&amp; v)
  [[post old_size = size(): size() == old_size + 1]];</pre>

<p>This would cover use cases:</p>

</ul>


<h4><a name="analysis.compatible.liskov">2.3.4. Different but compatible preconditions and postconditions in derived classess</a></h4>

<p>Although we do not know yet how this would be handled in detail, it remains compatible with our model if overriding functions in derived classes have relaxed preconditions, 
and under some conditions more constrained postconditions. This would address:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1995r0.html#cppapi.class.preconditions"><code>cppapi.class.preconditions</code></a>,</li>

</ul>


<h3><a name="analysis.compatible">2.4. Use-Cases Incompatible with Our Model</a></h3>

<p>The contract support facility described in this paper only allows declaring predicates which indicate a presence of a bug in the program
when they evaluate to <code>false</code> a certain well-defined moments. Plus smoe second-level annotations for controlling the tools. This
framework cannot be used to declare or check properties of functions, such as runtime complexity, thread-safety or having strong exception safety.</p>

<h2><a name="conclusion">3. Conclusion</a></h2>
 
 
	<p>While the proposed MVP is conservative, we believe that even the MVP may
    contain a number of unresolved small issues that will require time to polish. With EWG attention
    almost entirely consumed by controversial bits of C++20 contracts, the uncontroversial bits
    may not have been given sufficient consideration for attention. If we are to ship any
    contract programming support in C++23 time frame, we have to be sure that we have a small
    enough scope to be accommodated by the WG21 process.</p>

    <p>
    The biggest advantage of this MVP is that we provide a standard notation for expressing
    preconditions and postconditions. This notation will be consumed by many tools, which are not
    necessarily compilers. The positive effect on the community is not necessarily in what compilers
    can do with it, but also what other automated tools can get from it. This is far beyond the
    scope of the C++ Standard.</p>
