Side Effects in Contract Conditions
===================================

The specification of contract statements in the current [[WD]][1] is that any side effect that occurs during the evaluation of any
contract condition is undefined behavior. The rationale for this is that programmers are expected to use only *pure* (referentially
transparent) expressions in contract conditions, as otherwise reasoning about these conditions as predicates is impossible.
