<h1>Contracts and coroutines</h1>


<p> This paper proposes how preconditions and postconditions should interact with
    coroutines. </p>

<p> Coroutines generalise regular functions in a specific manner: control can
    return to the caller even though the function body has not finished executing.
    This gives rise to some doubts as to whether the semantics of postconditions,
    as defined for regular functions, still apply. 
    This paper solves this problem, and therewith addresses one of the concerns of a major
    tool-chain vendor expressed in 
    <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3173r0.pdf"

</ul>



<h2><a class="sect" id="1">1.</a> Executive summary</h2>


<p> The key observation is that, in current C++, one cannot tell from a function
    declaration, or call, whether the callee is a coroutine or a 'regular' function.
    </p>

<p> We reformulate the definition of a postcondition so that
    it does not refer to the function body.</p>

<p> We derive the properties for pre- and postconditions on coroutines:</p>

<ul>
    <li> they should be allowed on declarations of functions that are later defined
         as coroutines,</li>
    <li> the program state they describe and the point of their evaluation relate to
         the call site,</li>
    <li> postconditions should not relate to the state of the coroutine or the time
         when it finishes.</li>
</ul>    



<h2><a class="sect" id="2">2.</a> Motivation</h2>


<p> Because the start of a coroutine is conceptually no different than the start of a 
    normal function, also the motivation for expressing a precondition is the same as for
    normal functions:</p>

<pre>
generator&lt;int&gt; sequence(int from, int to)
  pre (from &lt;= to);
  </pre>

<p> But when we return to the caller, the situation is different. The caller doesn't get
    the ultimate result of the operation. Instead, it gets a <em>tool</em> (a generator,
    a callback, an awaitable) for <em>advancing</em> the state of the
    of the asynchronous operation.</p>

<p> Thus, there are fewer things to express in the postcondition. Less need to access 
    function parameters (as they are often used to match against the returned result),
    no option to inspect the ultimate result. The only practical thing is to inspect the 
    state of the said tool:</p>    

<pre>
awaitable&lt;int&gt; cancelable_session(int id) 
  post (r: is_cancelable(r));
  
void caller()
{
  awaitable&lt;int&gt; s = cancelable_session(1);
  contract_assert (is_cancelable(s));
  global_cancelable_sessions.push(std::move(s));
}
</pre>




<h2><a class="sect" id="3">3.</a> Coroutine properties</h2>


<h3><a class="sect" id="3.1">3.1.</a> The ramp function</h3>


<p> The C++ Standard does not clearly define the <em>ramp function</em>; however,
    this notion is crucial for implementing C++ coroutines in a compiler, for 
    understanding coroutines as a user, and for us to design the semantics of 
    postconditions. </p>

<p> When the compiler encounters a coroutine definition — that is, a function body with
    one of the coroutine keywords — it generates two things:</p>
    
<ol>
    <li>The <em>coroutine state (frame)</em>, possibly heap-allocated, storing the copies 
        of function parameters, and tracking the the progress of the function body.</li>
    <li>The <em>ramp function</em>.</li>
</ol>   
   
<p> The ramp function has the following properties:</p>   

<ul>
    <li>It is a normal (non-coroutine) function.</li>
    <li>It prepares the coroutine state.</li>
    <li>It executes the part of the coroutine body, until the first suspension  
        (or till the end, if no suspension is requested).</li>
    <li>It returns the <em>return object</em> obtained from the coroutine promise object.
        </li> 
    <li>You cannot see its body: it is compiler-generated, based on coroutine
        customization points.</li>
    <li>This is the function that the caller actually calls.</li>
</ul>

<p> The crucial property here is that it is a normal function. Hence, whatever 
    <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2900r8.pdf"
       title="Joshua Berne, Timur Doumler, Andrzej Krzemieński et al., 
       &ldquo;Contracts for C++&rdquo;">[P2900R8]</a>
    has to say about pre- and postconditions for normal functions, can also be applied
    to the ramp function.    
    </p>   
   

<h3><a class="sect" id="3.2">3.2.</a> The normal function interface</h3>

<p> There is no hint in a function declaration, whether it is a coroutine or not.
    When you invoke a coroutine, you are invoking a (normal) ramp function. Hence,
    the caller has no way of telling if there is a coroutine involved in the call:
    </p>

<pre>
awaitable&lt;int&gt; session(int id);   <em>// may be a coroutine, may be a function</em>

awaitable&lt;int&gt; default_session()  <em>// definitely a normal function</em>
{
  awaitable&lt;int&gt; s = session(0);  <em>// maybe invoking a coroutine, maybe a function</em>
  return s;
}
</pre>

<p> Even though a function is returning a type that may be indicative of a coroutine 
    implementation — an <em>Awaitable</em> or a <em>generator</em> — these are just types,
    and they can be as well returned by normal functions, such as factories, or forwarding
    functions.
    </p>
  


<h3><a class="sect" id="3">3.3.</a>  Copies of function parameters </h3>


<p> A notable thing, performed by the ramp function, is to <em>copy</em>  
    the function parameters into the coroutine frame
    <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.fct.def.coroutine#13">[dcl.fct.def.coroutine]/13</a>:</p> 
    
<blockquote>For a parameter of type <em>cv</em> <code>T</code>, 
    the copy is a variable of type <em>cv</em> <code>T</code> 
    with automatic storage duration that is direct-initialized 
    from an xvalue of type <code>T</code> referring to the parameter.
    </blockquote>
    
<p> Thus defined initialization can end up in performing a <em>move</em>, even if a
    function parameter is declared <code>const</code> by the user. 
    This means that effectively the ramp function behaves as if its function parameters 
    had their <code>const</code> qualification removed from the defining declaration.
    </p>
    



<h2><a class="sect" id="4">4.</a> Redefining postconditions</h2>


<p> Most code is sequential, therefore usually the definitions of pre- and postconditions
    make a silent assumption that we are describing sequential (non asynchronous)
    function calls and function definitions. In this view, the evaluation of the
    postcondition happens: </p>    
    
<ol>
    <li>After the function body has finished (local automatic objects have been 
        destroyed).</li>
    <li>After the control is returned to the caller (the result object has been
        initialized).</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, for normal functions these two are the same thing.</p>

<p> In case of coroutines, the above two are potentially different points in time,
    and the "sequential" definition of a postcondition cannot be maintained.
    </p> 

<p> We observe that the first property above bears no relation to the caller, and a 
    postcondition, as part of a function contract, is about describing the relation
    between the caller and the callee. Therefore we argue that the first property can
    be dropped without compromising the goal of a postcondition.
    </p>

<p> We propose the following conceptual model. Any remaining part of the coroutine body,
    after the ramp function returns to the caller, can be treated as a callback 
    <em>C</em> returned to the caller. The caller may call <em>C</em> later or never, but
    is not directly affected by the results of calling <em>C</em>.</p>

<p> An equivalent formulation of our model is that pre- and postconditions should behave
    as if we wrapped the call to a coroutine function into a factory function <em>F</em>,
    declared the same contract in <em>F</em>, and called it instead.
    </p>



<h3><a class="sect" id="4.1">4.1.</a> Postconditions and function bodies</h3>



<p> One effect of the proposed model is that the function body bares no connection
    to the predicate expressed in the postcondition:</p>
    
<pre>
awaitable&lt;int&gt; cancelable_session(int id) 
  post (r: is_cancelable(r))
{
  int ans = co_await communicate(id);
  co_return ans;
}
</pre>

<p> In the above example there is nothing in the function body that would indicate
    that the returned <code>r</code> is made "cancelable". 
    </p>

<p> Occasionally, the function body might give a false impression that it relates to the 
    postcondition assertion:
    </p>

<pre>
task&lt;int&gt; fun(int&amp; obj)
  <em>// postcondition: obj &gt;= 0</em>
{
  <em>// ...</em>
  obj = 1; <em>// evaluated long after the postcondition</em>
  co_return;
}
</pre>

<p> This is behavior is <em>not</em> a consequence of this proposal, but of the coroutine 
    mechanics. Note that the notion of a "postcondition", even though not expressible as
    a language feature in the present C++, does exist. Authors of coroutines must already
    take this effect into account.
    </p>    
    
    
    
<h2><a class="sect" id="5">5.</a> Inspecting coroutine parameters</h2>



<p> The only technical challenge is about inspecting the function parameters in pre-
    and postcondition assertions, given that these parameters are potentially moved to the
    coroutine frame. This problem applies only to non-reference parameters. 
    </p>

<p> Preconditions must be evaluated before this move. This is because function parameters
    may be used in the call to the allocation function that provides the storage for the
    coroutine frame. This may cause a situation surprising to the programmers: a
    precondition assertion sees different 
    objects than the coroutine body. As a result, the same predicate can give different
    results in the two places, when the address of the object is inspected, or when the
    copy/move constructor of the class creates objects in a state that is different than 
    the state of the source object.
    </p>

<p> However, we note that this surprising behavior predates contracts and is inherent to
    the coroutine design in C++. Even in C++23 programmers may be surprised that the 
    parameters the coroutine body sees are not the ones that they passed as arguments.
    </p>
    
<p> The challenge for the postconditions is that at the point they are evaluated,
    the copying of the parameters had already occurred and the parameters are potentially
    in a moved-from state: definitely not the state that the caller intends to inspect.
    </p>
    
<p> We propose to make it ill-formed when a coroutine function has a postcondition 
    that odr-uses a non-reference parameter.
    This decision is a consequence of two other decisions already made:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2900r8.pdf"
           title="Joshua Berne, Timur Doumler, Andrzej Krzemieński et al., &ldquo;Contracts for C++&rdquo;"
        >[P2900R8]</a>
        makes the program ill-formed when a postcondition (in a normal function)
        references a non-<code>const</code>, non-reference function parameter.
        </li>
    <li>The present specification of coroutines allows the implementations to move from
        <code>const</code> function parameters, effectively behaving as if the top-level
        cv-qualifications were removed from the parameters.
        </li>
</ol>

<p> The rationale for requiring <code>const</code> for non-reference function parameters
    (for normal functions) has been provided in 
    <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2466r0.html"
       title="Andrzej Krzemieński, &ldquo;The notes on contract annotations&rdquo;"
    >[P2466R0]</a>.</p>
    
<ol>
<li>Allowing the mutation (for instance, moving from) of function parameters
    would make the predicate test a different condition than what the author intended.
    This would go against the design goals for contracts, which is not to introduce 
    false-positive or false-negative results, and especially not new undefined behavior. 
    </li>
<li>Making silent additional copies would prevent the programmers from reasoning about 
    the program performance, would still not work for non-copyable types, and would cause
    the same problems as in (1) above for types that provide copy constructor, but with 
    unusual semantics.    
    </li>  
<li>Simply disallowing any postcondition whatsoever would be unnecessarily harsh,
    as often postconditions want only to constrain the return value.
    </li>    
</ol>

<p> <a title="Timur Doumler, Peter Bindels, Joshua Berne, &ldquo;Contract assertions on coroutines&rdquo;">[P3387R0]</a>
    considers additional alternatives:</p>
    
<ol start="4">
<li>Have the postconditions refer to the copies of function parameters residing in the 
    coroutine frame. We consider it undesirable, as the coroutine frame may not exist
    at the point where the postcondition is evaluated. Making it work would require 
    changes to coroutine mechanics and compromise another goal, that adding contracts
    annotations shouldn't change the behavior of a correct code.
    </li>
<li>Allow the postconditions to refer to objects, as long as their move constructor is
    trivial or not defined. First, it doesn't solve the problem: it just reduces its 
    scale. Second, it has a negative consequence that if a user-defined type is modified, 
    so that it obtains a move constructor, it can suddenly make the compilation fail in
    the remote and seemingly unrelated parts of the program.
    </li>
</ol>
    
<p> <a title="Timur Doumler, Peter Bindels, Joshua Berne, &ldquo;Contract assertions on coroutines&rdquo;"
      >[P3387R0]</a>
    compares trade-offs for all these options, and ultimately reaches
    the same conclusion.
    </p>
  

<p> As a consequence, while for normal functions the programmer can enable a 
    postcondition to odr-use a non-reference parameter via adding the <code>const</code>
    qualification to that 
    parameter in all declarations, this will be impossible for coroutines.</p>  

<p> <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2461r1.pdf"
       title="Gašper Ažman, Caleb Sunstrum, Bronek Kozicki, &ldquo;Closure-Based Syntax for Contracts&rdquo;">[P2461R1]</a>
    proposes a future addition to postcondition assertions that would allow the user
    to capture (copy) function parameters upon the function entry, so that these
    copies are available when evaluating the postcondition expression upon
    function return. Referring to such captures is safe, and the copying would
    be explicit. This would enable the postconditions to refer to coroutine
    parameters:</p>

<pre>
generator&lt;int&gt; sequence(int from, int to)
  pre (from &lt;= to)
  post[from, to] (g : g.size() == to - from + 1);
  </pre>

   


<h2><a class="sect" id="6">6.</a>  Coroutine-specific guarantees </h2>


<p>
    <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2932r3.pdf"
       title="Joshua Berne, &ldquo;A Principled Approach to Open Design Questions for Contracts&rdquo;"
       >[P2932R3]</a>
    argues against integrating pre- and postconditions with coroutines too early:
    </p>


<blockquote>
    <p> Currently, no concrete proposal covers the full breadth of the interface a 
        coroutine has with its callers. Without this complete picture, we cannot yet know
        if <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> will have a meaning that is correct and 
        useful to those calling into or implementing coroutines.
        </p>
</blockquote>


<p> In the light of a clearer description of a coroutine call as a call to the ramp 
    function, we are confident that the model for pre- and postconditions we described,
    is the only one possible.
    </p>

<p> While it is true that one could invent different kinds of correctness checks — like
    constraints on what the returned awaitable yields upon <code>co_await</code>, or
    testing the coroutine state at different time points — this problem is no 
    different from checking the state of regular functions at different points of 
    execution or checking the behavior of callbacks returned from regular
    functions. Yet, SG21 did not decide to hold off contracts on regular functions
    only because there is not a complete picture for regular functions. Any additional
    correctness checks, if needed, can be added on top of what we propose.
    </p>




<h2><a class="sect" id="7">7.</a> Proposal</h2>


<p> We propose that preconditions on coroutines be allowed. Their evaluation is
    sequenced after the function parameters are initialized, and before
<ul>
  <li> the potential allocation of a coroutine frame 
       <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.fct.def.coroutine#9">[dcl.fct.def.coroutine]/9</a>,</li>
  <li> the initialization of the coroutine promise object
       <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.fct.def.coroutine#5.7">[dcl.fct.def.coroutine]/5.7</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p> Parameter names referenced in the precondition predicate
    refer to the original parameters before the move to the coroutine frame.</p>

<p> We propose that postconditions on coroutines be allowed, and have the
    following properties.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The program is ill-formed when a coroutine postcondition odr-uses a
        non-reference function parameter.</li>
    <li>Postcondition evaluation is sequenced after the value, if any, has been
         returned from the ramp function to the caller, and before the function
         parameters (which are moved-from at that time) have been destroyed. </li>
    <li>The postcondition evaluation is unsequenced with respect to the termination
         of the evaluation of the coroutine body and the destruction of its
         automatic variables.</li>

<h2><a class="sect" id="8">8.</a> Wording</h2>


<p> <a title="Timur Doumler, Peter Bindels, Joshua Berne, &ldquo;Contract assertions on coroutines&rdquo;">[P3387R0]</a>
    provides wording that is compatible with what is proposed here.

<h2><a class="sect" id="9">9.</a> Implementability</h2>



<p> Currently the only compiler to implement contracts and coroutines is GCC. 
    It implements the <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0542r5.html"
       title="G. Dos Reis, J. D. Garcia, J. Lakos, A. Meredith, N. Myers, B. Stroustrup, &ldquo;Support for contract based programming in C++&rdquo;">[P0542R5]</a>
    version of contracts.
    </p>

<p> The implementation in trunk implements <code>[[assert: _]]</code>
    and <code>[[pre: _]]</code> as proposed in this paper.
    Here is a working example in Compiler Explorer:
    <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x5bTW5W6o">https://godbolt.org/z/x5bTW5W6o</a>.
    </p>

<p> The implementation of <code>[[post: _]]</code> differs from the proposed
    semantics in one aspect: postconditions are allowed to odr-use non-reference
    function parameters, which results in the assertion expressions observing
    the moved-from state of the parameters.   
    </p>
    
<p> The GCC implementation puts the runtime checks for pre- and post-conditions
    inside the ramp function.  This reflects that the current GCC implementation
    for contracts is callee-only.  On-going work to prototype virtual function
    handling is thought to be adaptable to general caller-side contracts and to
    be compatible with coroutines without any special action.
